                Iâ€™m a final-year BCA student with a strong foundation in Core
                Java and frontend development. Over the past year, I have built
                several frontend projects, which helped me strengthen my skills
                in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and modern UI design.
                Currently, I am expanding my knowledge into backend technologies
                as I work towards becoming a proficient MERN stack developer. I
                enjoy solving problems and translating ideas into clean,
                responsive, and user-friendly web applications. My goal is to
                continuously learn, improve, and contribute to impactful
                projects that make a difference. I believe in consistent growth,
                adaptability, and teamwork, and Iâ€™m excited to start my career
                as a frontend/full-stack developer.
